# Communication Basics MATLAB Codes

This repository contains MATLAB codes for basic communication concepts. Below is a brief description of each file:

## Mid Tread Quantization.m
This file implements mid-tread quantization, which is a method used in digital signal processing for analog-to-digital conversion.

## am_modulation.m
Implements amplitude modulation (AM), a modulation technique used in electronic communication.

## dsbc.m
Implements double-sideband suppressed-carrier (DSBC) modulation, another modulation technique commonly used in communication systems.

## first.asv
## first.m
These files seem to be related, but without further context or description, it's hard to provide details.

## flat_top_sampling.m
Implements flat-top sampling, a technique used in signal processing for accurate representation of signals.

## freq_modulation.asv
## freq_modulation.m
These files are likely related to frequency modulation (FM), a modulation technique widely used in radio broadcasting.

## pcm.m
Implements pulse code modulation (PCM), a method used for converting analog signals into digital signals.

## prac.asv
## prac.m
Similar to 'first.asv' and 'first.m', these files appear to be related to a practice session, but further context is needed for a detailed description.

## pulseCodeModulation.m
Similar to 'pcm.m', this file implements pulse code modulation.

## sampling_freq.asv
## sampling_freq.m
These files likely involve sampling frequency, a crucial parameter in digital signal processing and communication systems.

## second.m
This file might be related to the second part of a project or exercise, but more information is needed for clarification.

## sin_wave.m
Implements generation or manipulation of a sinusoidal waveform, commonly used in various communication applications.

## squaremodulation.m
Implements square modulation, another modulation technique used in communication systems.

Please refer to individual files for more detailed comments and explanations on the implemented algorithms and techniques.
