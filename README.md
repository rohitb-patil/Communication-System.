# Communication Basics MATLAB Codes

## This repository contains MATLAB codes for basic communication concepts. Below is a brief description of each file:

- ***Mid Tread Quantization.m*** : This file implements mid-tread quantization, which is a method used in digital signal processing for analog-to-digital conversion.
-  ***am_modulation.m*** : Implements amplitude modulation (AM), a modulation technique used in electronic communication.
- ***dsbc.m*** : Implements double-sideband suppressed-carrier (DSBC) modulation, another modulation technique commonly used in communication systems.

- ***Samplin_reconstruction.m*** : This MATLAB code simulates the process of sampling and reconstruction of a continuous-time sinusoidal signal.

-  ***flat_top_sampling.m*** : Implements flat-top sampling, a technique used in signal processing for accurate representation of signals.

-  ***freq_modulation.m*** : These files are likely related to frequency modulation (FM), a modulation technique widely used in radio broadcasting.


- ***pcm.m*** : Implements pulse code modulation (PCM), a method used for converting analog signals into digital signals.


- ***prac.m***  : These files appear to be related to a practice session, but further context is needed for a detailed description.

 - ***pulseCodeModulation.m*** : Similar to 'pcm.m', this file implements pulse code modulation.


- ***sampling_freq.m*** : These files likely involve sampling frequency, a crucial parameter in digital signal processing and communication systems.


- ***sin_wave.m*** : Implements generation or manipulation of a sinusoidal waveform, commonly used in various communication applications.

- ***squaremodulation.m*** : Implements square modulation, another modulation technique used in communication systems.
